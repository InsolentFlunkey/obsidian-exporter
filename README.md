## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the App

1. **Update default Vault and Export locations in script (optional but recommneded)**
   ```
   # === User-defined defaults (modify these paths as desired) ===

   ```

2. **Launch the app**
   1. **Launch via uv** (recommended):
      ```bash
      uv run python obsidian_exporter.py [--vault_root PATH] [--export_dir PATH]
      ```

   2. **Or activate the venv manually and run**:
      ```bash
      # Windows PowerShell
      .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

      # macOS/Linux
      source .venv/bin/activate

      python obsidian_exporter.py [--vault_root PATH] [--export_dir PATH]
